<h1>Someone To Call My Lover [Excerpt]</h1>
<em>Janet Jackson</em>

<p> Back on the road again, feeling kinda lonely and 
    <br> Looking for the right guy, who'd be mine 
    <br> Friends say I'm crazy 'cuz easily I fall in love
    <br> "You gotta do it different J, this time" </p>

<p>Maybe we'll meet at a bar
    <br>He'll drive a funky car
    <br>Maybe we'll meet at a club
    <br>And fall so deeply in love
    <br>He'll tell me I'm the one
    <br>And we'll have so much fun
    <br>I'll be the girl of his dreams, maybe</p>
